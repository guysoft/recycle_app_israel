Electronics  Map View Israel
============================

This is a simple app to view all the electronics recycle location in israel.

This app is currently proof of concept and is not really usable yet.



Why is this app the only way to see the data on mai.org.il on my phone?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The data is held by mai.org.il on their website which do not allow you to download and redistribute it by copyright law.
Their website has a shitty map that loads all the data in to one lambda function.
This app does not store the information, but downloades the page, parses it and then shows it.


Features
--------

* Shows a map with your locaiton of where to recucle stuff.


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Currently runs only on andorid or linux, could be extended to work on iOS
#. Uses kivy, mapview and python3

Code contribution would be appreciated!
